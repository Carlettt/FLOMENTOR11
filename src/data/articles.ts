    fullContent: `The menstrual cycle is a natural and recurring process that prepares your body for potential pregnancy. It spans around 28 days on average, though normal cycles can range from 21-35 days.

**The Four Phases of Your Menstrual Cycle:**

**1. Menstruation (Days 1-5)**
- The lining of your uterus (endometrium) sheds through your vagina
- Hormone levels (estrogen and progesterone) are at their lowest
- You may experience cramping, bloating, and mood changes
- This is considered Day 1 of your cycle

**2. Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)**
- Overlaps with menstruation but continues after bleeding stops
- Your pituitary gland releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
- Your ovaries begin developing eggs in follicles
- Estrogen levels start to rise, thickening the uterine lining
- You may feel more energetic and positive

**3. Ovulation (Around Day 14)**
- A mature egg is released from the ovary
- This is your most fertile time
- You may notice changes in cervical mucus (clearer, stretchier)
- Some women experience mild pelvic pain or spotting
- Body temperature may rise slightly

**4. Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**
- The empty follicle releases progesterone
- If pregnancy doesn't occur, hormone levels drop
- You may experience PMS symptoms like mood swings, bloating, breast tenderness
- This phase typically lasts 12-14 days

**Factors That Can Affect Your Cycle:**
- Stress and emotional changes
- Extreme exercise or sudden weight changes
- Hormonal imbalances
- Certain medications
- Underlying health conditions

Understanding these phases can help you better manage your health, predict fertility windows, and recognize when something might be unusual for your body.`

    fullContent: `Period pain (dysmenorrhea) affects up to 90% of menstruating women. While mild discomfort is normal, severe pain shouldn't be ignored. Here are natural methods to find relief:

**Heat Therapy - Your Best Friend**
- Apply a hot water bottle or heating pad to your lower abdomen or back
- Heat helps relax uterine muscles and increase blood flow
- Research shows heat therapy can be as effective as pain medication
- Try warm baths with Epsom salts for additional relaxation
- Sauna therapy has been shown to match pain medication effectiveness

**Exercise and Movement**
- Light cardio like walking can reduce cramps by releasing endorphins
- Yoga poses like child's pose, cat-cow, and supine twists can help
- Gentle stretching improves blood flow and reduces tension
- Avoid intense workouts that may worsen symptoms
- Even light movement is better than staying sedentary

**Dietary Approaches**
- Reduce inflammatory foods: processed foods, excessive sugar, caffeine
- Increase anti-inflammatory foods: leafy greens, fatty fish, berries
- Stay hydrated - dehydration can worsen cramps
- Limit salt to reduce bloating
- Consider magnesium supplements (consult your doctor first)

**Herbal Remedies**
- Ginger tea has anti-inflammatory properties
- Chamomile tea can help with relaxation and pain relief
- Turmeric contains curcumin, which reduces inflammation
- Cinnamon may help regulate menstrual cycles

**Lifestyle Changes**
- Manage stress through meditation or deep breathing
- Ensure adequate sleep (7-9 hours)
- Maintain regular meal times
- Consider massage or acupuncture

**When to Seek Medical Help:**
- Pain that doesn't respond to natural remedies
- Severe pain that interferes with daily activities
- Sudden changes in pain patterns
- Pain accompanied by heavy bleeding or fever

Remember: While these natural methods can be very effective, they work best when used consistently and as part of an overall healthy lifestyle.`

    fullContent: `Both PMS and PMDD occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (the two weeks before menstruation), but they differ significantly in severity and impact on daily life.

**PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome)**
PMS affects up to 75% of menstruating women and includes:

*Physical Symptoms:*
- Bloating and breast tenderness
- Mild fatigue and headaches
- Food cravings
- Mild cramping
- Sleep changes

*Emotional Symptoms:*
- Mood swings and irritability
- Mild anxiety or sadness
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feeling overwhelmed

PMS symptoms are manageable and don't typically interfere with work, relationships, or daily activities.

**PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder)**
PMDD is a severe form of PMS affecting 3-8% of women. It's considered a serious mental health condition.

*Severe Emotional Symptoms:*
- Intense mood swings and anger
- Severe depression or hopelessness
- Panic attacks
- Suicidal thoughts or behaviors
- Paranoia or feeling out of control
- Severe anxiety

*Physical Symptoms:*
- Similar to PMS but more intense
- Extreme fatigue
- Severe headaches
- Joint and muscle pain

**Key Differences:**
1. **Severity**: PMDD symptoms are much more intense and disruptive
2. **Duration**: Both last 1-2 weeks before menstruation, but PMDD completely interferes with daily life
3. **Impact**: PMDD significantly affects relationships, work performance, and quality of life
4. **Treatment**: PMDD often requires medical intervention

**When to Seek Help:**
- Symptoms severely impact your daily life
- You have thoughts of self-harm

- Symptoms don't improve with lifestyle changes

**Treatment Options:**
- Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, stress management)
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Antidepressants (SSRIs)
- Hormonal treatments
- Support groups

**Tracking Your Symptoms:**
Keep a symptom diary for 2-3 months to identify patterns and severity. This information is crucial for healthcare providers to make an accurate diagnosis.

Remember: Both PMS and PMDD are real medical conditions. You don't have to suffer in silence - effective treatments are available.`
