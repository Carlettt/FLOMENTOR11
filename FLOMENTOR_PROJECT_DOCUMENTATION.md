# FLOMENTOR PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

### 6.1 Coding Environment, Tools & Debugging Techniques

FloMentor is a mobile-first menstrual health tracking and wellness application developed using a modern, modular frontend-backend architecture. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS for responsive design. The backend utilizes Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative offering PostgreSQL, authentication, storage, and APIs. The app is optimized for Android deployment using CapacitorJS and served locally via Vite.

**Environment and Tools:**

| Component | Tool/Technology |
|-----------|----------------|
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage) |
| Development Env. | Visual Studio Code, Android Studio IDE |
| Build Tool | Vite |
| Version Control | Git, GitHub |
| Mobile Support | CapacitorJS |
| Testing Tools | Android Mobile Device, React DevTools, Postman, Supabase Console |
| Package Manager | npm |
| State Management | React Context API |
| Routing | React Router DOM |
| UI Components | Radix UI, shadcn/ui |

**Debugging Techniques:**
- Console logging to trace rendering and Supabase API errors
- Supabase dashboard for real-time database inspection
- Postman for API verification before frontend integration
- React DevTools and real Android device testing for UI validation
- Network tab monitoring for API call debugging
- Supabase analytics for database query performance

### 6.2 Program Listing

FloMentor's codebase is modular with clear separation of concerns. Key components include:

**Core Authentication System:**
```typescript
// src/context/AuthContext.tsx
export const AuthProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  const signUp = async (email: string, password: string, name: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email,
      password,
      options: {
        data: { name }
      }
    });
    // Handle response and profile creation
  };

  const signIn = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email,
      password
    });
    // Handle authentication response
  };
};
```

**Database Integration:**
```typescript
// src/integrations/supabase/client.ts
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(
  "https://sdfihcbjesuxbgftmuoo.supabase.co",
  "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  {
    auth: {
      storage: localStorage,
      persistSession: true,
      autoRefreshToken: true,
    }
  }
);
```

**Offline Storage Service:**
```typescript
// src/services/offlineStorage.ts
export class OfflineStorageService {
  private static instance: OfflineStorageService;
  private storageKey = 'flo-rhythm-offline-data';

  saveProfile(profile: Profile): void {
    const data = this.getOfflineData();
    const existingIndex = data.profiles.findIndex(p => p.id === profile.id);
    
    if (existingIndex >= 0) {
      data.profiles[existingIndex] = profile;
    } else {
      data.profiles.push(profile);
    }
    
    this.saveOfflineData(data);
  }
}
```

**Chat Integration with AI:**
```typescript
// src/components/ChatScreen.tsx
const sendMessage = async () => {
  const userMessage: ChatMessage = {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    message: inputMessage,
    isUser: true,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  };

  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('chat-completion', {
      body: { message: inputMessage }
    });
    
    if (error) throw error;
    
    const aiMessage: ChatMessage = {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      message: data.response,
      isUser: false,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    updateChatMessages([...chatMessages, userMessage, aiMessage]);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to offline service
  }
};
```

### 6.3 Test System / Program Testing

Testing ensured correct integration between the frontend and Supabase backend. This included user login, cycle tracking, chatbot queries, and symptom submissions. Tests were conducted using React test methods, Postman, and manual verification.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit Testing: Individual component functionality
- Integration Testing: Frontend-backend API communication
- User Acceptance Testing: Real device testing with target users
- Security Testing: RLS policy validation
- Performance Testing: Load testing with concurrent users
